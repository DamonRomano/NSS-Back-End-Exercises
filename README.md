# **NSS-Back-End-Exercises**
This repo holds all the files related to the various in-class _individual exercises_ I worked on during the back-end (Python, Django/DjangoREST, SQLite3) portion of my six-month, full-time, full-stack web developer bootcamp at Nashville Software School. 

Each individual exercise listed here will have its own .README.

Repos for NSS _group projects_ are in discrete repositories.
